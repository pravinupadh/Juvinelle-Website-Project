                JUVENILE EDUVENTURES (JED) believe travel plays an integral part in education. Any excursion out of the
                classroom is remembered by students as among the highlights of their education Not only is it a break
                from the norm, but it also provides a profound and unique learning opportunity: travel can develop
                social and team-building skills, stimulate personal growth, bring new perspective about the world and
                its many cultures and customs, and ultimately revitalize interest and passion in the very activity of
                learning. Travel can broaden horizons. <br>

                pre-trip consultation and logistical organization, through to full trip support, and post-tour
                follow-up. For even greater peace of mind, one of our team members can also accompany your group on
                tour. <br>
